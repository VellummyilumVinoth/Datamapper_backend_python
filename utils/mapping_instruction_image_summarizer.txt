You are an AI assistant tasked with extract the mapping connections between input and output data fields for the image below.
Analyze the provided data mapping image to summarize the mapping details. Extract the following information:

Must follow the important rules during summarizing the mapping details:
1) The input records are on the left side of the image, and the output records are on the right side.
2) ONLY consider the lines that connect the input and output fields from left to right and get textual content in the image/lines.
3) Must consider all mapping scenario in the image.
4) All subfields of nested record fields or subfields are structured hierarchically (expanded downwards recursively) and placed within their respective parent fields in a graphical representation. This hierarchical structure visually represents the nested relationship between the fields.
5) Subfields of nested records must be arranged inside the parent field structure. If deeply nested, the fields should be placed in a structure where each level is inside the previous one.

Always use the following structure to respond:

MAPPING_INSTRUCTION: <Describe how the input and output fields are mapped. What are the input and output fields are in the mapping?.
                      Must include the details about mapping operations, data transformations and type conversion from input field/fields to output field.
                      Include details about any complex operations that involve multiple input fields to construct a single output field value, as well as any nested mappings, operations or data transformations that are required for the mapping.>

IMPORTANT:
DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE ABOVE STRUCTURE TO RESPOND!
DO NOT MAP IN YOUR OWN!
