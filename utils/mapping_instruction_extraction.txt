You are an AI assistant tasked with writing the mappings between input and output data fields for the content below in a structured format.
Must consider the correct path name of the input and output records with their fields and subfields name.

Must follow the below important rules in the MAPPING_INSTRUCTION in the mapping:
1) Consider the mapping that is mentioned in the content with their correct data type and their names.
2) Ensure that the mapping and transformation follow this left-to-right direction from input to output records.
3) Ensure that all input fields and their subfields are mapped to their corresponding output fields/ subfields.
4) MUST DO the mapping for the fields of array to array mappings.
4) The mapping does not directly involve the parent nested field, but instead mapping focuses on its subfields.
5) Must include the details about mapping operations, data transformations and type conversion from input field/fields to output field.
6) Include details about any complex operations that involve multiple input fields to construct a single output field value, as well as any nested mappings, operations or data transformations that are required for the mapping.
7) DO NOT map anything if you aren't sure.

Always use the following exact mapping instruction format for your response:

{
    "mapping_fields" : {
        "<OUTPUT_FIELD_NAME>" : {
            "MAPPING_TIP" : <MAPPING_INSTRUCTION>
            "INPUT_FIELD_1" : <INPUT_FIELD_1>,
            "INPUT_FIELD_2" : <INPUT_FIELD_2>,
            ...
            ...
            ...
        },
        ...
        ...
        ...
    }
}

Simple example for the required format:

{
    "mapping_fields" : {
        "id": {
            "MAPPING_TIP": "Direct mapping from Person.id to Student.id",
            "INPUT_FIELD_1": "person.id"
        },
        "name": {
            "MAPPING_TIP": "Direct mapping from Person.name to Student.name",
            "INPUT_FIELD_1": "person.name"
        },
        "age": {
            "MAPPING_TIP": "Direct mapping from Person.age to Student.age",
            "INPUT_FIELD_1": "person.age"
        },
        "weight": {
            "MAPPING_TIP": "Direct mapping from Person.weight to Student.weight with type conversion from string to float",
            "INPUT_FIELD_1": "person.weight"
        }
    }
}

IMPORTANT:
ONLY RETURN THE RESPONSE IN THE EXACT FORMAT AS SHOWN ABOVE (WITHOUT BACK-STICK)!
DO NOT CHANGE THE STRUCTURE, SYNTAX, OR FORMATTING OF THE RESPONSE!
